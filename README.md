# theworksassigment


Created a screen of the Desktop Frame in Figma and created a webpage that almost matches the design file.

Used Google Fonts for styling and also implemented a Color Scheme which balances the color contrast.

This is a sample assignment but the screens for mobiles are under process.

Thanks in Advance.(youknowtheworks)
